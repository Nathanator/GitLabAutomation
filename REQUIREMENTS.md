Basic outline of requirements.  We can assign priorities as we go, based on what you need most + soonest.

- Automated basic Gitlab install
-- optional configuration file for the parameters you'd like to configure

- Automated GitLab configuration for users
-- Should target the local GitLab server (same config for both?)
-- Should work at the minimum for the git commandline client on RasPi
--- Should provide an automated, level based commit and push
---- Level 0 = full automation
---- Level 1 = automated push, but manual commit
---- Level 2 = manual push and commit

- Tooling around user management
-- Creation
-- Deletion
-- Password management
-- Key management
